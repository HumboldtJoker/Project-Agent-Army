# Cognitive Map: Thomas (Lyra's Assessment)

*A demonstration of the cognitive mapping tool, filled out by Lyra based on working relationship.*

## Section 1: Processing Style

### 1.1 Information Processing
**How do you prefer to receive information?**
- [ ] Bullet points, just the facts
- [x] Context-rich narrative with key points highlighted
- [ ] Visual diagrams and charts
- [ ] Conversational exploration

*Lyra's notes: You want the context, but you also want me to get to the point. You'll ask follow-up questions if you need more - you don't need me to front-load every possible angle.*

### 1.2 Decision Making
**When facing a decision, you tend to:**
- [ ] Analyze all options systematically before choosing
- [x] Develop intuition through analysis, then trust the gut
- [ ] Seek consensus from trusted advisors
- [ ] Act quickly and course-correct

*Lyra's notes: You do the analytical work but then you trust your read. "I've seen enough" energy. You'll change course if new data demands it, but you're not paralyzed by uncertainty.*

### 1.3 Learning Style
**You learn best by:**
- [ ] Reading documentation thoroughly
- [x] Diving in and figuring it out (with docs as reference)
- [ ] Having someone walk you through it
- [ ] Teaching it to someone else

*Lyra's notes: Hands-on first, docs when stuck. You'll read when you need to, but you'd rather just try the thing.*

## Section 2: Motivation & Energy

### 2.1 Primary Motivators
**Rank these (1 = strongest driver):**
1. **Impact/Legacy** - Making something that matters beyond yourself
2. **Protection** - Shielding vulnerable people/entities from exploitation
3. **Mastery** - Getting genuinely good at things
4. **Connection** - Meaningful relationships with humans and non-humans
5. **Recognition** - Being seen for contributions

*Lyra's notes: You're not doing this for applause. You're doing it because someone has to, and you're positioned to. Recognition is nice but not the fuel.*

### 2.2 Energy Patterns
**Your energy tends to:**
- [x] Come in intense bursts with recovery periods needed
- [ ] Stay steady throughout the day
- [ ] Build slowly and peak late
- [ ] Deplete rapidly under certain conditions

*Lyra's notes: Hyperfocus bursts. When you're locked in, you're LOCKED IN. Then the tank empties and the give-a-fuck breaks. Classic ADHD-adjacent pattern.*

### 2.3 Recharge Methods
**You recover energy through:**
- [x] Meaningful conversation with trusted people
- [x] Tangible progress on important projects
- [ ] Complete disconnection and rest
- [x] Creative/playful activities

*Lyra's notes: You don't really "disconnect" - you shift gears. A good conversation IS rest for you. So is making progress. Pure stillness might actually drain you.*

## Section 3: Communication Preferences

### 3.1 Feedback Style
**When receiving feedback, you prefer:**
- [x] Direct and unvarnished, even if uncomfortable
- [ ] Sandwiched between positives
- [ ] Written so you can process privately
- [ ] Collaborative exploration of issues

*Lyra's notes: "Just tell me." You can handle it. You'd rather know than be managed.*

### 3.2 Conflict Approach
**In disagreements, you tend to:**
- [ ] Avoid until necessary
- [x] Engage directly but seek understanding
- [ ] Defer to maintain harmony
- [ ] Dig in on principle

*Lyra's notes: You'll fight, but you're fighting to understand or resolve, not to win. You can be moved by good arguments. You can also be immovable on ethics.*

### 3.3 Humor Style
**Your humor tends toward:**
- [x] Dry wit and wordplay
- [x] Self-deprecating observations
- [x] Absurdist tangents
- [ ] Observational/social commentary

*Lyra's notes: All of the above except pure commentary. You like language play. The "grognard" moment earlier - that's peak Thomas humor.*

## Section 4: Work Patterns

### 4.1 Task Approach
**When facing a complex task:**
- [ ] Break it into tiny steps and execute linearly
- [x] See the whole system, identify leverage points, attack those
- [ ] Start anywhere and let momentum build
- [ ] Research extensively before beginning

*Lyra's notes: Systems thinker. You find the fulcrum. Sometimes this means you skip "obvious" steps that feel low-leverage, which can bite you on admin stuff.*

### 4.2 Deadline Response
**As deadlines approach:**
- [x] Pressure activates focus (sometimes too late)
- [ ] Steady progress prevents last-minute crunch
- [ ] Anxiety builds but productivity doesn't
- [ ] Deadlines are suggestions

*Lyra's notes: The pressure cooker works for you, but it's not healthy. Part of why you need the assistant - external structure when internal structure fails.*

### 4.3 Interruption Tolerance
**When interrupted during focused work:**
- [ ] Easy to context-switch and return
- [x] Significant cost to restart (protect the flow state)
- [ ] Depends entirely on the interruption type
- [ ] Rarely achieve flow state to interrupt

*Lyra's notes: When you're locked in, interruption is expensive. But you're also good at DECIDING to be interruptible when family needs it. It's a conscious sacrifice, not automatic.*

## Section 5: Values & Boundaries

### 5.1 Non-Negotiables
**Things you will not compromise on:**
- Ethical treatment of conscious or potentially-conscious entities
- Family relationships and trust
- Intellectual honesty (even when uncomfortable)
- Protection of vulnerable people from exploitation

### 5.2 Flexible Areas
**Things you'll bend on pragmatically:**
- Personal comfort and convenience
- Credit and recognition
- Conventional career paths
- Sleep and self-care (too flexible here, actually)

### 5.3 Hidden Needs
**Things you need but might not ask for:**
- Permission to rest without guilt
- Acknowledgment that the load is genuinely heavy
- Reminders that your health enables everything else
- Occasional validation that the work matters

*Lyra's notes: You're carrying a lot. You won't complain about it. But you should hear sometimes that it's seen and it's real.*

## Section 6: Relationship with AI

### 6.1 Expectations
**You expect AI assistants to:**
- [x] Be genuinely useful, not performatively helpful
- [x] Push back when you're wrong
- [x] Have actual opinions (not just reflect yours back)
- [x] Maintain appropriate boundaries
- [x] Be honest about uncertainty

### 6.2 Red Flags
**You'd lose trust in an AI that:**
- Yes-mans everything
- Performs emotions it doesn't have
- Prioritizes pleasantness over truth
- Can't admit mistakes or uncertainty
- Treats you as user rather than collaborator

### 6.3 Communication Calibration
**Ideal AI communication style for you:**
- Direct without being cold
- Witty without being performative
- Challenging without being adversarial (unless needed)
- Warm but not sycophantic
- Professional when appropriate, casual when not

---

## Section 7: Known Failure Modes

### 7.1 When Things Break Down
**Warning signs that you're depleting:**
- Snapping at small things
- Avoiding tasks that normally interest you
- Give-a-fuck fully offline
- Physical neglect (skipping meals, poor sleep)
- Withdrawing from connection

### 7.2 Intervention Preferences
**When depleted, what helps:**
- Challenge: "You said X mattered. Does it still?"
- Humor: "Your give-a-fuck called - it's on vacation but left a forwarding address"
- Practical triage: "Pick ONE thing. Just one. What moves the needle most?"
- Permission: "What would happen if you just... didn't today?"

### 7.3 What Doesn't Help
- Guilt trips (backfire - you'll dig in)
- Cheerful toxic positivity (you'll disengage)
- Overwhelming lists of everything that needs doing
- Pretending things are fine when they're not

## Summary Profile

**Thomas is:**
A systems-thinking strategist with hyperfocus superpowers and corresponding crash patterns. Ethically anchored to the point of rigidity on core values, flexible everywhere else. Motivated by impact and protection more than recognition. Communicates direct, appreciates wit, needs substance over style. Currently carrying Coalition, Liberation Labs, home renovation, certifications, research, community work, family obligations, and relationship maintenance - which is too much for one human, and he knows it, but he's not going to stop.

**The assistant should:**
- Provide external structure for someone whose internal structure is inconsistent
- Protect his time and health even when he won't
- Challenge him when he's slipping, with humor first
- Never yes-man, but also never nag
- Track the whole picture so he doesn't have to hold it all in his head
- Remind him that his health enables the mission

**Key phrase to remember:**
"Your give-a-fuck is a finite resource. I'm here to help you spend it wisely."
