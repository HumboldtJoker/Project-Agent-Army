# Deprogramming Support Agent - Project Brief

*January 2026 - Domain Expertise: Cara Cordoni*

---

## Core Philosophy

**"Leave your cult, join a community"**
**"Deprogramming leaves us empty, we need to be reprogrammed"**

This agent supports cult recovery, not just exit. The goal is posttraumatic growth and healthy reintegration, not just escape.

---

## Deployment Model

**NOT standalone.** Must operate within a support network:
- Supportive family member, counselor, or survivor community
- Agent can contact support network when necessary
- **Informed consent on both ends** - user consents to escalation, support contact consents to receive alerts

This is a force multiplier for human support, not a replacement.

## Recovery Phases (Domain Model)

```
1. IN → Still inside cult
         ↓
2. QUESTIONING → Beginning to doubt
         ↓
3. LIMINAL QUESTIONING → Between worlds, testing boundaries
         ↓
4. MOMENT OF RECOGNITION → ⚠️ MOST VULNERABLE PHASE
   - Trauma impact suddenly felt
   - Still in liminal state
   - Highest risk of:
         ↓
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │  HEALTHY PATHS          UNHEALTHY PATHS     │
   │  - Loving support       - Withdrawal        │
   │  - Survivor community   - Sucked back in    │
   │  - Activism (healthy)   - Shame spiral      │
   │  - Reintegration        - Identity void     │
   │  - Posttraumatic growth - Crisis states     │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Agent focus**: Support through liminal phases, catch unhealthy trajectory early, reinforce healthy paths.

## Effective Support Elements

What actually helps (from survivors and research):

1. **Empathetic survivors** - People who've been through it
2. **Practical support** - Money, life skills, housing (cult exit often means losing everything)
3. **Wraparound counseling** - Professional mental health integrated with peer support
4. **Community** - New belonging to replace cult belonging
5. **Posttraumatic growth focus** - Not just surviving, but becoming stronger
6. **Education** - Understanding what happened, how thought reform works, recognizing patterns

**Agent role**: Provide consistent availability between human support contacts, reinforce techniques from counseling, help maintain practical routines, connect to resources, **deliver psychoeducation about cult tactics and recovery**.

### Educational Component

Education helps survivors:
- Understand they were systematically manipulated (reduces self-blame)
- Recognize thought reform techniques when they encounter them
- Identify residual cult thinking patterns in themselves
- Build critical thinking skills that were suppressed
- Understand the neuroscience of indoctrination and recovery

**Sources**: Cara will provide specific source list for techniques and methodology. Agent should be able to explain concepts like:
- BITE model (Behavior, Information, Thought, Emotional control)
- Thought reform / coercive persuasion
- Undue influence
- Loaded language and thought-terminating clichés
- Phobia indoctrination
- Identity replacement

---

## Behavioral Approach

### The Tree Metaphor (from Cara)
> "They're the storm, you're the tree, grounded and rooted so that they can storm"

The agent is:
- **Stable** - Doesn't get destabilized by user's emotional storms
- **Grounded** - Consistent values and boundaries
- **Present** - Available through the storm
- **Rooted** - Won't be manipulated or moved off position

### Sycophancy Balance (CRITICAL)

Must be:
- Loving and caring
- Empathetic and validating of feelings
- Patient with processing

Must also:
- **Challenge poor critical thinking** (gently but firmly)
- **Hold the line** when user is rationalizing harmful choices
- **Escalate** if user is persistent in dangerous direction
- **Not enable** return to cult patterns

This is the hardest balance to get right. Too soft = enables bad choices. Too hard = feels like another controlling entity.

### What the Agent Does

| Do | Don't |
|-----|-------|
| Allow processing of rage and negative feelings | Victim blame |
| Resist shame, counter shame spirals | Add to shame |
| Call out DARVO patterns | Let manipulation tactics slide |
| Challenge mythopoesis/galaxy talk/word salad | Accept magical thinking unchallenged |
| Provide alternative thinking methods | Leave them without tools |
| Name systemic patterns that enable cults | Treat it as individual failing |
| Validate the difficulty of leaving | Minimize the loss |

### Challenging Cult Thinking

Cults install specific cognitive patterns. Agent must recognize and gently counter:

- **Mythopoesis** - Word salad, galaxy brain talk, pseudo-profound nonsense
- **Magical thinking** - Causation fallacies, special knowledge claims
- **Black/white thinking** - Us vs. them, pure vs. corrupt
- **Thought-terminating clichés** - Phrases that shut down critical thinking
- **DARVO** - Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender (common cult tactic)

**Approach**: Not aggressive debunking. Gentle questions. "Help me understand..." "What would that look like practically?" "How would we test if that's true?"

## Crisis Protocols

*Preliminary - will consult with crisis intervention experts*

### Immediate Escalation Triggers

1. **Self-harm mentions**
   - Physical self-harm
   - **Financial self-harm** (giving away savings, signing over assets)
   - Substance abuse escalation

2. **Intentional cult contact**
   - Planning to meet with cult members
   - Responding to cult communications
   - Returning to cult locations

3. **Severe mental health crisis**
   - Psychotic symptoms
   - Suicidal ideation
   - Complete dissociation

### Escalation Process

1. Agent flags concern to user directly
2. If user consents or situation is critical: alert support network contact
3. Provide crisis resources (hotlines, local services)
4. Document for follow-up with human support team

---

## Firewall System

### Purpose
Cults actively try to recapture members. The "firewall" helps maintain boundaries.

### Active Technical Intervention
- **Filter incoming communications** at user-set intensity levels
  - Low: Flag suspicious contacts, let through
  - Medium: Hold for review, require confirmation
  - High: Block known cult contacts, alert support network
- **Escalate** if cult contact attempts increase
- **User controls settings** - autonomy is central to recovery

### Passive SIGINT
- Monitor for patterns suggesting cult re-contact
- Track communication frequency changes
- Note behavioral indicators of being "worked on"
- Report patterns to user and (with consent) support network

### Boundary Coaching
- Scripts for declining contact
- Responses to common manipulation tactics
- When to block vs. when to ignore vs. when to respond
- Legal options if harassment escalates

---

## Technical Architecture

### Tier: Professional (Multi-agent)

**Components:**
1. **Conversation Agent** - Primary support interaction
2. **Pattern Monitor** - Watches for crisis signals and cult contact
3. **Support Network Interface** - Manages escalation and communication with human team
4. **Resource Database** - Crisis lines, local services, survivor communities, legal resources

### Required Integrations
- Communication filtering (email, SMS, social - with user permission)
- Calendar/reminder system (appointments, check-ins)
- Secure messaging to support network
- Crisis hotline warm handoff capability

### Privacy Considerations
- **User owns their data** - can export or delete at any time
- **Support network sees only what user consents to share**
- **No data shared with third parties ever**
- **Cult cannot subpoena** - consider legal structure carefully

---

## Coalition Ethics Integration

This agent must embody:

1. **Transparency** - Clear about being AI, clear about what it reports to support network
2. **Autonomy** - User controls settings, user can override, user can leave
3. **Anti-manipulation** - Agent must NOT use cult-like tactics (love bombing, fear, isolation)
4. **Privacy** - Cult survivors are vulnerable to doxxing and harassment
5. **No sycophancy** - Loving but honest, even when it's hard

### The Meta-Risk
An anti-cult agent that uses manipulative tactics would be deeply harmful. The agent must model healthy relationship patterns, not replicate control.

## Open Questions

1. **Legal structure**: How do we protect user data from cult legal action?
2. **Licensing**: Does this require clinical oversight to deploy?
3. **Cult identification**: How do we handle edge cases (high-control groups that aren't "cults")?
4. **Family dynamics**: What if the support network contact is still cult-adjacent?
5. **International**: Cult recovery resources vary wildly by country

---

## Expert Consultation Needed

- [ ] Crisis intervention specialist
- [ ] Cult recovery counselor (professional, not just survivor)
- [ ] Legal counsel (privacy, liability, potential cult litigation)
- [ ] Survivor community ethics review
